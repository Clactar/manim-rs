# Implementation Plan Review - 2025-10-19

## Executive Summary

✅ **Your implementation plan is fundamentally sound.** The core insight—building from foundations upward—is correct.

⚠️ **Key changes made**: Added Phase 1.2 (extended math) before rendering, reordered some tasks, clarified dependencies.

---

## What You Got Right

1. ✅ **Dependency hierarchy**: Phase 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 is correct
2. ✅ **Rendering-first approach**: Building SVG backend before mobjects is smart
3. ✅ **Detailed task breakdown**: Clear, actionable steps with time estimates
4. ✅ **TDD methodology**: Test-first approach will catch issues early
5. ✅ **Milestone-driven**: "Static Shapes" milestone is achievable and measurable

---

## Critical Issues Fixed

### 1. **Missing Phase 1.2: Extended Math**

**Problem**: You jumped from basic types (Vector2D, Color) directly to rendering, but the renderer needs geometric primitives.

**Why this matters**:

- The `Path` type contains Bézier curve commands (`CubicTo`, `QuadraticTo`)
- Circles in Manim are approximated with 4 cubic Bézier curves
- Text glyphs are converted to Bézier paths

**Solution**: Added Phase 1.2:

- `BoundingBox` - For spatial queries
- `CubicBezier` / `QuadraticBezier` - For smooth curves
- `Angle` types - For clean rotation API

**Timeline impact**: +4-5 days (now 4-5 weeks to Milestone 1, was 3-4)

---

### 2. **BoundingBox Placement**

**Original**: Phase 2.1.3 (after renderer trait)  
**Corrected**: Phase 1.2.1 (before rendering)

**Reason**: BoundingBox only depends on `Vector2D`, and is needed by:

- Path transformations
- Mobject spatial queries
- Scene culling

---

### 3. **Path Style Separation**

**Original**: `PathStyle` defined inline in renderer trait  
**Corrected**: Separate file `src/renderer/style.rs`

**Reason**: Better organization, easier to extend (add `StrokeStyle`, `FillStyle`, etc.)

---

### 4. **Animation Task Order**

**Original**:

1. Timeline (depends on Animation)
2. Animation trait
3. Easing

**Corrected**:

1. Animation trait (foundation)
2. Easing functions (no dependencies)
3. Timeline (uses Animation + Easing)

**Reason**: Dependencies must be built before dependents.

---

### 5. **Mobject Trait Simplification**

**Original**: Included `color()`, `set_color()` methods  
**Corrected**: Removed from base trait

**Reason**: Color is specific to `VMobject` (stroke vs. fill). Base trait should be minimal.

## Key Takeaways

### For Basic Manim (Milestone 1)

**Essential**:

- ✅ Phase 1.1 (done)
- 🔄 Phase 1.2 (BoundingBox, Bézier)
- 📋 Phase 2 (Rendering)
- 📋 Phase 3.1-3.2 (Mobjects, geometric shapes)

**Deferred to later**:

- Text rendering (complex font handling)
- LaTeX support (external process)
- 3D math (Vector3D, Quaternion)
- GPU rendering
- Advanced animations

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Start with Phase 1.2** - BoundingBox first (1 day), then Bézier curves (2-3 days)
2. **Each task**:
   - Write failing test
   - Implement minimum functionality
   - Make test pass
   - Document with examples
   - Run clippy/fmt
3. **Don't skip steps** - Each phase builds on previous ones
4. **Test incrementally** - Verify each component before moving on

## Timeline (Revised)

| Phase                       | Time          |
| --------------------------- | ------------- |
| Phase 1.2: Extended Math    | 4-5 days      |
| Phase 2.1: Rendering Traits | 4-6 days      |
| Phase 2.2: SVG Backend      | 5-7 days      |
| Phase 3.1: Mobject Base     | 4-5 days      |
| Phase 3.2: Shapes           | 6-8 days      |

## What to Build First (Phase 1.2)

### Task 1.2.1: BoundingBox (1 day)

```rust
// src/core/bounding_box.rs
pub struct BoundingBox {
    pub min: Vector2D,
    pub max: Vector2D,
}

impl BoundingBox {
    pub fn from_points(points: &[Vector2D]) -> Self;
    pub fn union(&self, other: &BoundingBox) -> BoundingBox;
    pub fn contains(&self, point: Vector2D) -> bool;
}
```

### Task 1.2.2: Bézier Curves (2-3 days)

```rust
// src/core/bezier.rs
pub struct CubicBezier {
    pub start: Vector2D,
    pub control1: Vector2D,
    pub control2: Vector2D,
    pub end: Vector2D,
}

impl CubicBezier {
    pub fn eval(&self, t: f64) -> Vector2D;
    pub fn split_at(&self, t: f64) -> (CubicBezier, CubicBezier);
    pub fn bounding_box(&self) -> BoundingBox;
}
```

### Task 1.2.3: Angles (1 day, optional)

```rust
// src/core/angle.rs
pub struct Radians(pub f64);
pub struct Degrees(pub f64);

impl From<Degrees> for Radians { /* ... */ }
```

## Questions Answered

### "Should we use the `svg` crate?"

**Recommendation**: Start with hand-crafted SVG XML (simple string building). The `svg` crate adds complexity for minimal benefit at this stage. You can always refactor later.

### "Should VMobject own or borrow its Path?"

**Recommendation**: Own (`path: Path`). Lifetimes complicate the API, and paths are small enough to clone cheaply. Optimize later if needed.

### "Feature flags for backends?"

**Recommendation**: Yes, but keep it simple:

```toml
[features]
default = ["svg"]
svg = []
gpu = []  # Future
```

## Validation Against Manim CE

I analyzed the [Manim Community repository](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim) and verified:

1. ✅ **Bézier curves are fundamental**: `manim/utils/bezier.py` has extensive Bézier utilities
2. ✅ **VMobject is the base**: Most shapes inherit from `VMobject`
3. ✅ **Paths use Bézier**: `manim/mobject/types/vectorized_mobject.py` stores cubic curves
4. ✅ **Renderer abstraction**: Cairo backend implements abstract renderer interface
5. ✅ **Animations modify mobjects**: Confirmed dependency order

Your architecture mirrors Manim CE's proven design while leveraging Rust's strengths.
