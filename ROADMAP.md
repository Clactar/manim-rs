# Manim-rs Development Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation plan for manim-rs, organized by dependency hierarchy. Each phase builds upon the previous ones.

## Current Status: Phase 2 (In Progress ðŸ”„)

---

## Phase 1: Core Mathematical Foundations âœ…

**Status**: COMPLETED  
**Dependencies**: None

### 1.1 Basic Math Types âœ…

- [x] `Vector2D` - 2D vectors with operations
- [x] `Color` - RGBA color representation with hex support
- [x] `Transform` - 2D transformation matrices
- [x] Error handling system

### 1.2 Extended Math Types âœ…

- [x] `BoundingBox` - Axis-aligned bounding boxes for spatial queries
- [x] `QuadraticBezier` / `CubicBezier` - BÃ©zier curve utilities
- [x] Angle types (`Radians`, `Degrees`)
- [ ] `Vector3D` - 3D vectors for future 3D support (defer to Phase 7)
- [ ] `Matrix` - General matrix operations (defer to Phase 7)
- [ ] `Quaternion` - 3D rotations (defer to Phase 7)

**Why First**: Everything else depends on these primitives. Vectors define positions, colors define appearance, transforms define motion. BoundingBox and BÃ©zier curves are needed before rendering can work properly.

---

## Phase 2: Rendering Foundation

**Status**: In Progress ðŸ”„  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1.1 âœ…, Phase 1.2 âœ…  
**Estimated Complexity**: High

### 2.1 Rendering Traits & Abstractions

- [ ] `Renderer` trait - Backend-agnostic rendering interface
- [ ] `PathStyle` / `TextStyle` - Rendering style types
- [ ] `Path` - 2D path representation with BÃ©zier commands
- [ ] `RenderContext` - Shared rendering state (optional for Milestone 1)
- [ ] `Layer` system for depth control (defer to Phase 5)

### 2.2 SVG Backend (Priority 1)

- [ ] SVG path generation
- [ ] SVG element rendering (shapes, text)
- [ ] SVG file output
- [ ] SVG animation support (SMIL)

### 2.3 Raster Backend (Priority 2)

- [ ] Integration with `tiny-skia` for CPU rasterization
- [ ] PNG/JPEG image export
- [ ] Frame buffer management

### 2.4 GPU Backend (Future - Optional)

- [ ] `wgpu` integration for hardware acceleration
- [ ] Shader system
- [ ] GPU-accelerated transformations

**Why Second**: We need to be able to draw before we can animate. The renderer is independent of scene logic and can be tested with simple shapes.

---

## Phase 3: Mathematical Objects (Mobjects)

**Status**: Not Started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1, Phase 2.1-2.2  
**Estimated Complexity**: Medium-High

### 3.1 Base Mobject System

- [ ] `Mobject` trait - Common interface for all drawable objects
- [ ] `MobjectProperties` - Shared properties (position, color, opacity)
- [ ] `MobjectGroup` - Container for multiple mobjects
- [ ] Hierarchy and parent-child relationships

### 3.2 Geometric Primitives

- [ ] `Point` - Single point
- [ ] `Line` - Line segment
- [ ] `Circle` - Circle/arc
- [ ] `Rectangle` / `Square`
- [ ] `Polygon` - Regular and irregular polygons
- [ ] `Arc` - Circular arcs
- [ ] `Arrow` - Arrows with customizable tips
- [ ] `Ellipse`

### 3.3 Complex Shapes

- [ ] `BezierPath` - Arbitrary bezier curves
- [ ] `VMobject` - Vectorized mobject (from paths)
- [ ] `CurvesAsSubmobjects` - Complex compound shapes
- [ ] SVG import and parsing

### 3.4 Text Rendering

- [ ] Font loading and management
- [ ] `Text` mobject with font/size/weight
- [ ] `MarkupText` - Rich text with formatting
- [ ] Glyph path extraction
- [ ] Text measurement and layout

### 3.5 Mathematical Notation (Later Priority)

- [ ] LaTeX integration (via external process)
- [ ] `MathTex` - Mathematical equations
- [ ] `Tex` - General LaTeX text
- [ ] Symbol library for common math symbols

**Why Third**: Mobjects are what we actually render. They need the rendering backend but are independent of animation logic. We can test them by rendering static frames.

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. Start with geometric primitives (easiest to test)
2. Add text support (requires font handling)
3. Add LaTeX support last (most complex, external dependency)

---

## Phase 4: Animation System

**Status**: Not Started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1, Phase 3.1-3.2  
**Estimated Complexity**: High

### 4.1 Time and Interpolation

- [ ] `Timeline` - Manages animation timing
- [ ] Easing functions library:
  - Linear, smooth (ease in/out)
  - Cubic, exponential, elastic
  - Custom easing function support
- [ ] `Interpolatable` trait for smooth transitions
- [ ] Rate functions and timing utilities

### 4.2 Core Animation Primitives

- [ ] `Animation` trait - Base for all animations
- [ ] `AnimationGroup` - Parallel/sequential animation groups
- [ ] `Wait` - Pause animation
- [ ] `Succession` - Chain animations

### 4.3 Transform Animations

- [ ] `Transform` - Morph one mobject into another
- [ ] `ReplacementTransform` - Replace with interpolation
- [ ] `TransformFromCopy` - Animate a copy
- [ ] `ClockwiseTransform` / `CounterclockwiseTransform`

### 4.4 Creation/Destruction Animations

- [ ] `Create` / `Uncreate` - Draw/undraw paths
- [ ] `Write` - Animated writing effect
- [ ] `FadeIn` / `FadeOut` - Opacity animations
- [ ] `GrowFromCenter` / `ShrinkToCenter` - Scale animations
- [ ] `DrawBorderThenFill` - Outline then fill

### 4.5 Movement Animations

- [ ] `MoveToTarget` - Move to specified position
- [ ] `ApplyMethod` - Animate method application
- [ ] `Rotate` - Rotation animation
- [ ] `Shift` - Translation animation
- [ ] `Scale` - Scaling animation

### 4.6 Indication Animations

- [ ] `Indicate` - Highlight temporarily
- [ ] `Flash` - Brief flash effect
- [ ] `FocusOn` / `CircleIndicate` - Draw attention
- [ ] `Wiggle` - Shake/wobble effect

**Why Fourth**: Animations modify mobjects over time. They need mobjects to exist and the rendering system to display frames, but they're self-contained logic.

**Implementation Strategy**:

1. Build timing/interpolation foundation first
2. Add simple animations (fade, move) to test the system
3. Add complex animations (transform, morph)
4. Add indication/effect animations last

---

## Phase 5: Scene Management

**Status**: Placeholder exists  
**Dependencies**: Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3, Phase 4  
**Estimated Complexity**: Medium

### 5.1 Scene Core

- [x] `SceneConfig` - Scene configuration (resolution, fps, etc.)
- [ ] `Scene` - Main scene orchestration
- [ ] Scene timeline management
- [ ] Frame rate control and timing
- [ ] Background color/image support

### 5.2 Camera System

- [ ] `Camera` - Virtual camera
- [ ] Pan, zoom, rotate camera
- [ ] Camera frame and viewport management
- [ ] `MovingCamera` - Animated camera
- [ ] Multiple camera support

### 5.3 Scene Methods (Manim API compatibility)

- [ ] `self.add()` - Add mobjects to scene
- [ ] `self.remove()` - Remove mobjects
- [ ] `self.play()` - Play animations
- [ ] `self.wait()` - Pause
- [ ] `self.next_section()` - Scene sections

### 5.4 Advanced Scene Features

- [ ] `ThreeDScene` - 3D scene support (future)
- [ ] `VectorScene` - Vector field scenes
- [ ] `GraphScene` - Graphs and plots
- [ ] Section markers for editing

**Why Fifth**: Scenes orchestrate everything else. They need mobjects, animations, and rendering to be complete. This is where the user-facing API lives.

---

## Phase 6: Output and Export

**Status**: Not Started  
**Dependencies**: Phase 2, Phase 5  
**Estimated Complexity**: Medium-High

### 6.3 Interactive Preview

- [ ] Live preview window (optional)
- [ ] Real-time playback
- [ ] Scrubbing timeline
- [ ] Interactive controls

**Why Sixth**: Export is the final step - we need scenes fully working before we can export them. Video encoding is independent of the core animation logic.

- [ ] Particle systems
- [ ] Collision detection
- [ ] Spring/pendulum simulations

### 7.4 Interactive Features

- [ ] Mouse/keyboard input handling
- [ ] Interactive widgets
- [ ] Real-time manipulation

### 7.5 Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Parallel rendering with Rayon
- [ ] Object culling and frustum culling
- [ ] Level-of-detail (LOD) system
- [ ] Caching and memoization

**Why Last**: These are enhancements to the core system. Each depends on a solid foundation.

## Roadmap Review Notes (2025-10-19)

### Key Improvements Made

1. **Clarified Phase 1.2**: BoundingBox and BÃ©zier curves must come before rendering
2. **Deferred 3D math**: Vector3D, Matrix, Quaternion moved to Phase 7 (not needed for 2D Manim)
3. **Simplified Phase 2.1**: Removed premature abstractions (RenderContext, Layer system)
4. **Updated dependencies**: Phase 2 now correctly depends on Phase 1.2
5. **Realistic timeline**: Milestone 1 is now 4-5 weeks (was 3-4)

### Critical Path for Milestone 1

```
Phase 1.2 (BoundingBox, BÃ©zier)
  â†’ Phase 2.1 (Renderer trait, Path, PathStyle)
  â†’ Phase 2.2 (SVG Backend)
  â†’ Phase 3.1 (Mobject trait, VMobject)
  â†’ Phase 3.2 (Circle, Rectangle, Line)
  â†’ âœ… Milestone 1: Render static shapes to SVG
```
